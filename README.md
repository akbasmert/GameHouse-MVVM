## Description

-> The Game House application is designed using the MVVM architecture. 

-> The application consists of three screens: Main Screen, Detail Screen, and Favorites Screen.

-> When a search is performed, the data from the API is filtered and displayed after entering the first three letters.

-> The games added to favorites are saved using CoreData.

-> Unit Tests and UI Tests were written to test whether the application works properly.
